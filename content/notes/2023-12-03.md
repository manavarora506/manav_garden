### Day Review:
Felt pretty sick the whole day, but got a lot of work done. Back-propagation is pretty neat. Need to continue to read up on ML, NLP, LLM topics. Pretty lackluster week when it comes to workouts and diet. Need to be better next week. Just stay consistent and make it a habit to read more.
