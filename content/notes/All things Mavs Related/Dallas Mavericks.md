I have an unhealthy obsession with Dallas Mavericks Basketball. This will be a safe place for me to vent and brag about how good Luka and Lively are.

## Mavs vs Bucks - 11/18/23
#### My thoughts:
- Mavs offense is wordly
- Mavs defense sucks
- Josh Green shoulda been in the Kyrie trade
- Kyrie is a wizard
- Luka is still a baby 
- If we rely on Powell in the 4th, that's a loss
- Really need [[Lively]] to stay out of foul trouble
- Grant was good for three quarters, stunk in the 4th
