### Day Review:
Pretty productive morning and afternoon. Got a lot of errands done. Later end of my day was pretty lazy. I feel like there is still so much to learn about development. Need to put in a lot of hours tomorrow to learn some of these topics. Need to also work on the advent of code assignments. See if I can try to catch up.
