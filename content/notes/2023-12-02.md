### Day Review:
- I had a really good pull day. Back is still sore. I feel slightly better but still kinda sick. Finished Hitchiker's guide to the galaxy. It was a pretty good book, definitely made me laugh. Went to the Frisco Star and ate at Common Table. The vibes were cool and I was surprised to see how busy that area was. I need to learn more about [[Backpropagation]].
