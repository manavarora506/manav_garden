### Daily Log:
Wasn't able to get much done on my task list outside of work because something came up, but things are hopefully turning in the right direction now.
### Day Review:
Work was pretty chill. Still working on the same ticket. Need to make some progress tomorrow and try to get a PR out. Saw my girlfriend. Had a fun trip to Home Depot and Kroger's. She's amazing and deserves the world.
