Day Review:
Felt pretty sick today so didn't get much done at work today. I know my task at hand though. Made a pretty impulsive decision to go to the Mavs vs Grizzlies game with my gf. While we did lose, I got a free shirt and the tickets got refunded. Ended the night by eating at Bawarchi. Need to get back on routine tomorrow.
