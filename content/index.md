I'm [Manav](https://manavarora.me). I'll mainly write notes here about machine learning, distributed systems, and [[Idea List|things I'm building]]. You can browse on the left, explore the graph on the right, or search the whole site with `âŒ˜+K`.

[[notes|All notes]] are in one of three states:
- [[seed|Seed]]: brief ideas
- [[sapling|Sapling]]: fully-formed thoughts
- [[evergreen|Evergreen]]: permanent, constantly growing

These days I am learning more about full-stack development, generative AI, and cloud computing.
